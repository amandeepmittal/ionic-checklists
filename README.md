## About CheckLists
It will contain items that could checked off as an indication to mark them done. There are lists and each list  contain any number of items. Any list can be edited or deleted permanently by the user. A list can be restart by the user to repeat the same procedure of doing things (represented as items in the list) for next time. There are tasks we need to perform every time, like if you are a traveller, you'd want to perform/pack things that necessary for every journey. Another one, is weekly grossing. You need to buy a same things every week/month and if you have a list that holds items, you don't have to remember everything and there are no chances you will forget to buy anything when you are the supermarkter. The idea of this app is of a repeatable to do list.
