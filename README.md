## About CheckLists
The whole idea of **CheckLists** comes from _repeatable_ todo lists.
A list that can be reset to reuse again instead of adding writing a traditional todo list. This particular list can be restart by the user to repeat the same procedure/number of tasks (represented as items in the list) for next or in later time.

Imagine, you travel a lot and you to make sure a certain amount of items to carry before you are eligible to travel without creating chaos in your comfort zone.
From passport to your Kindle charger & favorite underwear. <b>CheckLists</b> will remind of you all.
You can even add emojis as items. ðŸ™‚
